# Face-Mask-Detection
This project is a Face Mask Detection System using Deep Learning (VGG16) and Computer Vision (OpenCV). It classifies faces into two categories: ðŸ˜· With Mask and ðŸš« Without Mask. The model was trained on a Kaggle dataset with Transfer Learning and integrated with OpenCV for real-time detection.
